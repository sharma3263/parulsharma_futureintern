# Internship Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a collection of projects I completed during my internship. These projects demonstrate my skills and experience in machine learning, data analysis, and natural language processing. Below is an overview of each project:

## Projects

### 1. CIFAR-10 Image Classification

#### Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating various machine learning models for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, and birds.

#### Key Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model building using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning

#### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `cifar-10` directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `cifar10_classification.ipynb` to see the implementation and results.

### 2. Rule-Based Chatbot

#### Overview
This project involves the creation of a simple rule-based chatbot. The chatbot is designed to respond to predefined user queries and provide appropriate responses.

#### Key Features
- Implementation of a rule-based engine
- Predefined set of user queries and responses
- Interactive user interface using Streamlit

#### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `rule-based-chatbot` directory.

### 3. K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation
Overview
This project applies K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to improve marketing strategies and customer engagement.

Key Features
-Data preprocessing and normalization
-Implementation of K-means clustering algorithm
-Visualization of clusters
-Interpretation of clustering results
### How to Run
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the customer-segmentation directory.
Run the Jupyter notebook kmeans_clustering.ipynb to see the implementation and results.
